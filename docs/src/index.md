# Hello there!

![This is my cv! (minus stopwords)](img/wordcloud.svg)

Here you can find some notes, snippets, reflections, summaries, and general thoughts on
what I find interesting to save on my daily basis. Topics  are usually related to one of:

* Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing,
  Computer Vision, and firends.
* Python in general.
* CI, Devops.
* Iot Devices.
* Embedded computing.
* Mechanical Keyboards.

## gists

These are quickreads (`<10[min]`) which show something very specific. Most of these
provide small tweaks aimed at boosting unix/docker/python-related productivity.

## tutorials

I expect to save time redirecting people here (:

## projects

These are somewhat more involved, and might require some previous background to
understand / make sense of.
